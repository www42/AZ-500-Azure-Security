# Module 1 - Lab 2: Key Vault (Implementing Secure Data by setting up Always Encrypted)


**Scenario**

This module includes the following tasks:

 - Azure confidential computing
 - Azure Azure Key Vault


## Exercise 1: Introduction to Azure Key Vault


**Scenario**

In this lab, you will get started with Azure Key Vault to create a hardened container (a vault) in Azure, to store and manage cryptographic keys and secrets in Azure. First you will use Azure PowerShell. Then you will store a password as a secret that could then be used with an Azure application.

### Task 1: Download SQL Server Management Studio

1.  To download the latest version of SQL Management Studio required for this lab visit the following link and select download SQL Management Studio **`https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017`**

     **Note:** You do not need to wait for the SQL Management Studio to install   before continuing.

### Task 2: Use PowerShell to create a Key Vault


In this exercise, you will use PowerShell to create an Azure Key Vault.


1.  Start PowerShell by clicking **Start > PowerShell**

2.  Use the following command to authenticate to Azure using the account for your Azure subscription.

    ```powershell
    Login-AzAccount
    ```

4.  Create a new Resource Group 

    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroup -Name 'KeyVaultPSRG' -Location 'eastus'
    ```


5.  Create a key vault in the resource group. **The VaultName must be unique therefore change <keyvault name> to something unique.**

    ```powershell
    New-AzKeyVault -VaultName '<keyvault name>' -ResourceGroupName 'KeyVaultPSRG' -Location 'eastus'
    ```

    **Note**: The output of this shows important pieces of information: Vault Name in this case that is KeyVaultPS and the Vault URI: `https://KeyVaultPS.vault.azure.net`



6.  In the Azure Portal open the **KeyVaultPSRG** Resource Group.

7.  Click on the Key Vault name to examine what you have created.

    **Note**: For all future instructions replace KeyVaultPS with the name of your Key Vault.

8. Click **Access Policies** > **+ Add Access Policy**

9.  Select **Key, Secret and Certificate Management** from **Configure from template (optional)**

10. Click **Select Principal** and search for and then click on your account, then click on **Select**

11. Click **Add** and then **Save**

### Task 3: Add a key and secret to Key Vault

1.  Return to the PowerShell window.

2.  Add a software-protected key to the Key Vault using this command. Be sure to change the placeholder text to your vault name.

    ```powershell
    $key = Add-AZKeyVaultKey -VaultName '<YourVaultName>' -Name 'MyLabKey' -Destination 'Software'
    ```

3.  Move back to **KeyVaultPS** in the Azure portal. Click **Keys** under Settings in the left navigation pane.

4.  Click **MyLabKey**

5.  Click the Current Version.

6.  Examine the information about the key you created.

    **Note**: You can always reference this key by using its URI. To get the most current version, just reference `https://keyvaultps.vault.azure.net/keys/MyLabKey/` or if need be the exact version: `https://keyvaultps.vault.azure.net/keys/MyLabKey/da1a3a1efa5dxxxxxxxxxxxxxd53c5959e`


7.  Move back to the PowerShell window. To display the current version of the key, enter the following command.

    ```powershell
    $Key.key.kid
    ```


8.  To view the Key you just created you can use the Get-AzureKeyVaultKey cmdlet. Be sure to change the placeholder text to your vault name.

    ```powershell
    Get-AZKeyVaultKey -VaultName '<YourVaultName>'
    ```


### Task 4: Add a Secret to Key Vault

1.  Next, you will add a secret to the **KeyVaultPS**. To do this, add a variable named **$secretvalue** using the following code.

    ```powershell
    $secretvalue = ConvertTo-SecureString 'Pa55w.rd1234' -AsPlainText -Force
    ```


2.  Next add the secret to the Vault with this command. Be sure to change the placeholder text to your vault name.

    ```powershell
    $secret = Set-AZKeyVaultSecret -VaultName 'YourVaultName' -Name 'SQLPassword' -SecretValue $secretvalue
    ```

3.  Move back to the Azure Portal on **KeyVaultPS** and click **Secrets**

4.  Click the Secret **SQLPassword**

5.  Click the current version

6.  Examine the Secret that you created

    **Note**: You can always reference this key by using its URI. To get the most current version just reference `https://keyvaultps.vault.azure.net/secrets/SQLPassword` or if need be the exact version: `https://keyvaultps.vault.azure.net/secrets/SQLPassword/c5aada85d3acxxxxxxxxxxe8701efafcf3`


7.  Click the **Show secret value** button -- notice that the password appears.

8.  To view the Secret, use the Get-AzureKeyVaultSecret cmdlet. Be sure to change the placeholder text to your vault name.

    ```powershell
    Get-AZKeyVaultSecret -VaultName 'YourVaultName'
    ```

### Task 5: Enable a Client Application


You will enable your client application to access the Azure SQL Database service. This will be done by setting up the required authentication and acquiring the Application ID and Secret that you will need to authenticate your application. These steps will be accomplished in the Azure portal.


1.  Open the Azure portal and navigate to Azure Active Directory.

2.  Click **App Registrations** under **Manage** in the left navigation pane.

3.  **Click + New registration**

1.  Provide the name **sqlApp** for your application. Under **Redirect URI (optional)**, select **Web**, and for the SIGN-ON URL type **`https://sqlapp`**

5.  Click **Register**.

6.  Once the App Registration is complete click on **sqlApp** if it does not automatically appear.

7.  Copy your Application (client) ID as you will need it later.

8.  Click **Certificates & secrets**

9.  Click **+ New client secret**

10.  In the **Description** section, enter **Key1** for the description. Select **1 year** from the **Expires** list, then click **Add**


1.  Copy the Key1 value as you will need it later. If you close and reopen the blade, the value will show as hidden.

### Task 6: Add a Key Vault Policy allowing the application access to the Key Vault.

1.  In the **Azure portal** open your **Resource Group** created at the beginning of the lab

1.  Select the **Azure Key** vault

1.  Click **Access Policies**

1.  Select the account associated with your Azure subscription

1.  In the **Key Permissions** drop down select **Select All** to highlight all permissions

1.  Select **Save**

    **Important**! You must click save otherwise the permissions will not be committed 


8.  Run the following Powershell in the **Powershell ISE** to set the sqlApp key permissions replacing the placeholder text with **your account details**

    
    ```powershell
    $subscriptionName = '[Azure_Subscription_Name]'
    $applicationId = '[Azure_AD_Application_ID]'
    $resourceGroupName = '[Resource_Group_with_KeyVault]'
    $location = '[Azure_Region_of_KeyVault]'
    $vaultName = '[KeyVault_Name]' 
    ```
    
    ```powershell
    Login-AzAccount
    ```
    
    ```powershell
    Set-AZKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName $vaultName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -ServicePrincipalName $applicationId -PermissionsToKeys get,wrapKey,unwrapKey,sign,verify,list
    ```


 
### Task 7: Use Key Vault to Encrypt Data with Azure SQL Database


**Scenario**

In this task, you will create a blank Azure SQL Database, connect to it with SQL Server Management Studio and create a table. You will then encrypt two data columns using an autogenerated key from the Azure Key Vault. Then you will create a Console application using Visual Studio to Load data into the Encrypted Columns and then access that data securely using a connection string that accesses the key via Key Vault.


1.  From the Azure Portal click **+ Create a resource> Databases > SQL Database**

2.  Provide the following details on the SQL Database blade and click **Create**.

      - Resource Group: (create new) **SQLEncryptRG**
      
      - Database Name: **medical**

      - Server: **Create new**

          - Server name: **[Unique Server Name]**

          - Server Admin Login: **demouser**

          - Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

          - Location: **[same location as KeyVaultPS]**

          - Then click **OK**

      - Pricing Tier: Standard S0



1.  Once everything above is configured, select **Review + create,** then **Create**

3.  Once the SQL Database is deployed, open it in the Azure Portal to locate and then copy the **ADO.NET Connection String**.

**Note**: When you save the connection string for future use, be sure to replace {your_username} with **demouser** and {your_password} with **Pa55w.rd1234**.


### Task 8: Create a Table in the SQL Database

1.  Use the Azure portal to locate the Server name where the Medical Database is located and copy the name.



2.  On this same blade click Set Server firewall.



3.  Next click **+ Add client IP** and then click **Save**.



4.  Open SQL Server Management Studio. Connect to the Server using these properties for the **Connect to Server** dialog.

    - Server Name: **[found on the Database Overview Blade]**

    - Authentication: **SQL Server Authentication**

    - Login: **demouser**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**


### Task 9: Create and Encrypt a Table

1.  In SQL Server Management Studio expand **Databases > Right-click medical > New Query**.

2.  Paste the following code into the query window and click Execute

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Patients](

    [PatientId] [int] IDENTITY(1,1),

    [SSN] [char](11) NOT NULL,

    Install-Package Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.AlwaysEncrypted.AzureKeyVaultProvider
    ```

    ```powershell
    Install-Package Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory
    ```

1.  Open the **program.cs** file in notepad from Allfiles\\Labs\\Mod1_Lab02 and copy the code.

8.  Replace the code in **Program.cs** in Visual Studio with the code you just copied.

9.  Locate the **Connection string, clientId, and clientSecret** settings in the Main method and replace them with the values that you copied from the previous steps.

10.  **Click** the **Start Button** in **Visual Studio**.


1.  **The Console Application** will **Build** and then start. First it will ask for your password, then the app will add data to the database.

    - Server Password: **Pa55w.rd1234**

1.  **Leave** the **Console Application Running** and move to the **SQL Management Studio**. Right-Click the medical database and click **New Query**.



1.  Run the following query to see the data that was loaded into the database is encrypted.

    ```sql
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, SSN, BirthDate FROM Patients;
    ```


1.  Now, move back to the console application where you will be asked to **Enter** a **Valid SSN**. This will query the encrypted column for the data. Notice that with the key called from the Key Vault, now the data is unencrypted and shown to the console window.

    ```sql
    999-99-0003
    ```

1.  To **Exit** you press enter.
