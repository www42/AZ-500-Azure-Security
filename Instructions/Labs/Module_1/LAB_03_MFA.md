# Module 1: Lab 3: Using Multi-Factor Authentication for Secure Access


## Exercise 1: MFA Authentication Pilot (Require MFA for specific apps with Azure Active Directory conditional access)

### Task 1: Create your conditional access policy 


This section shows how to create the required conditional access policy. The scenario uses:

- The Azure portal as placeholder for a cloud app that requires MFA. 
- Your sample user to test the conditional access policy.  

In your policy, set:

|Setting |Value|
|---     | --- |
|Users and groups | Isabella Simonsen |
|Cloud apps | Microsoft Azure Management |
|Grant access | Require multi-factor authentication |

 
1.  Sign in to the Azure Portal.

2.  In the Azure portal, on the hub menu, click **Azure Active Directory**.

3.  In the **Properties** section, click **Manage Security defaults**.

4.  Change the **Enable Security defaults** option to **No**. Under reason, select **My organisation is using Conditional Access**, and click **Save**. 

5.  In the **Manage** section, click **Security**.

6.  In the **Security - Getting started blade**  click **Conditional access**.

7.  On the **Conditional Access** page, in the toolbar on the top, click **New Policy**.

    **Note**: if this is greyed out, refresh the browser session.




8.  On the **New** page, in the **Name** textbox, type **Require MFA for Azure portal access**.



9.  In the **Assignment** section, click **Users and groups**.



10.  On the **Users and groups** page, perform the following steps:

a. Click **Select users and groups**, and then select **Users and groups**.

b. Click **Select**.

c. On the **Select** page, select **Isabella Simonsen**, and then click **Select**.

d. On the **Users and groups** page, click **Done**.

11.  Click **Cloud apps or actions**.



12. On the **Cloud apps** page, perform the following steps:



    a. Click **Select apps**.

    b. Click **Select**.

    c. On the **Select** page, select **Microsoft Azure Management**, and then click **Select**.

    d. On the **Cloud apps** page, click **Done**.


13.  In the **Access controls** section, click **Grant**.


14.  On the **Grant** page, perform the following steps:
     1. Select **Grant access**.
     2.  Select **Require multi-factor authentication**.
     3.  Click **Select**.

15.  In the **Enable policy** section, click **On**.

16.  Click **Create**.


### Task 2: Evaluate a simulated sign-in


Now that you have configured your conditional access policy, you probably want to know whether it works as expected. As a first step, use the conditional access what if policy tool to simulate a sign-in of your test user. The simulation estimates the impact this sign-in has on your policies and generates a simulation report.  

To initialize the what if policy evaluation tool, set:

- **Isabella Simonsen** as user 
- **Microsoft Azure Management** as cloud app

 Clicking **What If** creates a simulation report that shows:

- **Require MFA for Azure portal access** under **Policies that will apply** 
- **Require multi-factor authentication** as **Grant Controls**.


1.  On the Conditional access - Policies page, in the menu on the top, click **What If**.

2.  Click **Users**, select **Isabella Simonsen**, and then click **Select**.



3.  To select a cloud app, perform the following steps:



    a. Click **Cloud apps or actions**.

    b. On the **Cloud apps page**, click **Select apps**.

    c. Click **Select**.

    d. On the **Select** page, select **Microsoft Azure Management**, and then click **Select**.

    e. On the cloud apps page, click **Done**.

4.  Click **What If**.

5.  Note the result, Require MFA for Azure portal access.

### Task 3: Test your conditional access policy

In the previous section, you have learned how to evaluate a simulated sign-in. In addition to a simulation, you should also test your conditional access policy to ensure that it works as expected. 

To test your policy, try to sign-in to the Azure portal **`https://portal.azure.com`** using your **Isabella Simonsen** test account. You should see a dialog that requires you to set your account up for additional security verification.




## Exercise 2: MFA Conditional Access (Complete an Azure Multi-Factor Authentication pilot roll out)


In this lab, you walk you through configuring a conditional access policy enabling Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (Azure MFA) when logging in to the Azure portal. The policy is deployed to and tested on a specific group of pilot users. Deployment of Azure MFA using conditional access provides significant flexibility for organizations and administrators compared to the traditional enforced method.

- Enable Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
- Test Azure Multi-Factor Authentication


### Task 1: Enable Azure Multi-Factor Authentication

1.  Return to the the Azure portal that is logged in as your Global Admin account.

1.  On the Hub menu click **Azure Active Directory**,

1.  Click **Groups** and click **+ New group**.

     ![Screenshot](../Media/Module-1/cb9c5324-cbb6-476e-9c7d-1920de301d40.png)

1.  Enter the following information then click **Create**:

      * Group type; **Security**
      * Group Name: **MFA Pilot**
      * Group description: **MFA Pilot Group**
      * Membership type: **Assigned**
      * Members: Select **Isabella**

2.  Browse to **Azure Active Directory**, click **Security** and select **Conditional access** on the **Security** Blade.

 

3.  Select **+ New policy**

 

4.  Name your policy **MFA Pilot**
5.  Under **users and groups**, select the **Select users and groups** check box
    * Select your pilot group **MFA Pilot**
    * Click **Select**
    * Click **Done**
    </br>
6.  Under **Cloud apps or actions**, select the **Select apps** radio button
    * The cloud app for the Azure portal is **Microsoft Azure Management**
    * Click **Select**
    * Click **Done**
    </br>
7.  Skip the **Conditions** section
8.  Under **Grant**, make sure the **Grant access** radio button is selected
    * Check the box for **Require multi-factor authentication**
    * Click **Select**
    </br>
9.  Skip the **Session** section
10. Set the **Enable policy** toggle to **On**
11. Click **Create**

### Task 2: Test Azure Multi-Factor Authentication


To prove that your conditional access policy works, you test logging in to a resource that should not require MFA and then to the Azure portal that requires MFA.


1.  Open a new browser window in InPrivate or incognito mode and browse to **`https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com`**
    * Log in with the test user created as part of the prerequisites section of this article and note that it should not ask you to complete MFA.
    * Close the browser window.

2.  Open a new browser window in InPrivate or incognito mode and browse to **`https://portal.azure.com`**

       * Log in with the test user created as part of the prerequisites section of this article and note that you should now be required to register for and use Azure Multi-Factor Authentication.
       * Close the browser window.

| WARNING: Prior to continuing you should remove all resources used for this lab.  To do this in the **Azure Portal** click **Resource groups**.  Select any resources groups you have created.  On the resource group blade click **Delete Resource group**, enter the Resource Group Name and click **Delete**.  Repeat the process for any additional Resource Groups you may have created. **Failure to do this may cause issues with other labs.** |
