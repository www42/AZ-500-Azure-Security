# Module 2: Lab 2 - Function Apps


Azure Function Apps uses the Azure App Service infrastructure. This topic shows you how to create a function app in the Azure portal. A function app is the container that hosts the execution of individual functions. When you create a function app in the App Service hosting plan, your function app can use all the features of App Service.

## Exercise 1: Create a Function and Trigger

### Task 1: Lab Setup

1.  Open PowerShell and run the following command:

     ```powershell
    start "https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoftLearning%2FAZ-500-Azure-Security%2Fmaster%2FAllfiles%2FLabs%2FMod2_Lab02%2Ftemplate.json" 
     ```

2.  Click **Create new** under the Resource Group section.
3.  Enter **myResourceGroup** as the name and click **OK**.
4.  Select the check box at the bottom of the blade to agree to the terms.
5.  Select **Purchase**


### Task 2: Add a HTTP trigger to your function app

1.  Select Resource groups

1.  Select the recource group you created in the lab setup

1.  Select the function app template that has been created in the resource group
warning
**Note**: There are no functions currently assgined to the function app


1.  Click **Functions**.

1.  Click **New Function**,

1.  In the top right click the slide button for Experimental Language support,
warning
**Note**: that other languages have now been added to the triggers


1.  Select **HTTP trigger**.

1.  Change the language to **PowerShell**.

1.  Leave the name as the default,

1.  Make sure **Authorization** Level is set to Function,

1.  Click **Create**.

 You have now created template PS1 HTTP trigger, if the template code does not show refresh the page 

### Task 3: Test a REST call to the HTTP trigger

1.  Note the name of the function app (**next to the function app icon**).

1.  Under the **HTTP trigger** function click **Manage**.

1.  Under funtion keys select copy under actions on the default function key and keep this in a notepad file

1.  Open **PowerShell ISE** and copy in PowerShell code from the following **URL**

     ```cli
    https://github.com/GoDeploy/AZ500/blob/master/AZ500%20Mod2%20Lab%202/RESTgetHTTPtrigger.ps1
     ```

1.  Populate the variable $functionappname = "" with the name of your function app

1.  Populate the variable $functionkey = "" with the long function key copied from the portal in the earlier step

1.  Run the powershell script

1.  In the results in the **ISE** you should see the following output

    ```powershell
    This is result of  a normal GET operation calling your HTTP trigger
    Hello 

    This is result of  a normal GET operation calling your HTTP trigger with an extra parameter passed to the trigger
    Hello World!

    This is result of a normal PUT operation calling your HTTP trigger that feeds a hash table converted to JSON to the HTTP triggger
    Hello Max Power
    ```

**Results**: You have successfully built a HTTP trigger function app and communicated to it using REST based commands.


| WARNING: Prior to continuing you should remove all resources used for this lab.  To do this in the **Azure Portal** click **Resource groups**.  Select any resources groups you have created.  On the resource group blade click **Delete Resource group**, enter the Resource Group Name and click **Delete**.  Repeat the process for any additional Resource Groups you may have created. **Failure to do this may cause issues with other labs.** |

**Congratulations**: You have now completed this lab.
